# Discord.py Cogs

A collection of cogs written in Python for Discord.py.

Updated to work with Discord.py Rewrite 1.3.0a

You can find specific documentation on the Discord.py library [here.](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

To implement a cog, read the info contained [in the documentation's Cog writeup.](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/cogs.html#cog-registration)

Optionally, you could do use [Rapptz's examples](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/master/examples) or [another one of my bots](https://github.com/xantbos/HorribleScrubs) for reference material on how to implement a Cog.

Please note none of the commands have any restrictions on who can use them. Implementing checks is outside the scope of concern. You can look at the bot example of mine I provided above if you want a good start on implementing checks.
